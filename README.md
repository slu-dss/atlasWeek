## Lesson Overview
This lesson provides an introduction to `R`, RStudio, and the `tidyverse`. It is targeted at participants who are not familiar with `R` or who use base `R` for much of their productivity.

### Objectives
At the end of this lesson, participants should be able to:

1. Create and manage `R` projects
2. Use `readr` to import data from `.csv` files
3. Employ `dplyr` to clean and manipulate data
4. Use `janitor` to create frequency tables
5. Create basic plots of data using `ggplot2`

### Lesson Resources
* The [`SETUP.md`](/references/SETUP.md) file in the [`references/`](/references) directory contains a list of packages required for this lesson
* The [`notebook/`](/notebook) directory contains a sample notebook and a completed notebook that emulate the template we use during lessons
* The [lesson slides](https://slu-dss.github.io/lesson-template/) provide an overview of `R`, RStudio, and project organization
* The [`references/`](/references) directory also contains other notes on changes to the repository, key topics, terms, data sources, and software.

### Extra Resources
* The [`tidyverse` website](http://tidyverse.org)
* Hadley Wickham's excellent [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) provides an excellent overview of how to use the `tidyverse` for various tasks

## About the SLU DSS
### Accessible Data Analysis: Using St. Louis Data to Explore Global Issues
In this workshop, we’ll use publicly available data about St. Louis to introduce open source data analysis software (`R`) that can be used to explore and respond to questions that are of concern to communities worldwide. We’ll use two local datasets to introduce participants to the art of data analysis: information on murders and lead poisoning for St. Louis.

Our goal is to showcase how to use basic data science skills to evaluate problems and meet the needs of different communities or organizations. The workshop will be hands-on and will include a brief introduction to the software and local data being used, demonstration of how to import and explore data, and discussion of the different types of analysis that can be performed and the diverse questions that can be addressed in `R`.

### About Atlas Week
The Sam and Marilyn Fox Atlas Week Program launched in Spring of 2001 as a way to recognize the international dimension of Saint Louis University's academic programs and to celebrate SLU's role in international education and service in light of our Jesuit tradition. One of the main goals of the Atlas Program is to increase awareness of the global issues that confront us today in an effort not only to promote discussion, but also to inspire and inform action. It focuses on what we as global citizens can do to contribute to a better life for all people now and in the future. The Atlas Program epitomizes the Jesuit mission of SLU and highlights how SLU truly is a place where "knowledge touches lives."

### About the SLU Data Science Seminar
The [SLU Data Science Seminar](https://slu-dss.githb.io) (DSS) is a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at Saint Louis University focused on building researchers’ data science skills using open source software. We currently host seminars focused on the programming language R. The SLU DSS is co-organized by [Christina Gacia, Ph.D.](mailto:christina.garcia@slu.edu), [Kelly Lovejoy, Ph.D.](mailto:kelly.lovejoy@slu.edu), and [Christopher Prener, Ph.D.](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu}). You can keep up with us here on GitHub, on our [website](https://slu-dss.githb.io), and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SLUDSS).
